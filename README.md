# INFO 443 Project 2 (chart.js)

## Context and Background

**What is the software system, and what does it do?**

`Chart.js` is an open-source JavaScript library for creating data visualizations. It can visualize your data in eight different ways, each of them animated, customizable, and responsive. It is great at rendering performance across modern browsers.

**Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it? Was it developed by a large company or an independent developer? Who seems to be in charge of approving changes to its code/architecture?)**

`Chart.js` was originally created by developer Nick Downie in 2013. It is now open for contribution by the entire developer community, but a dedicated `Chart.js` team of seven people is in charge of approving changes.

**Where can we find more information about the system?**
